# Planar Data Classification
This repository contains the code for a planar data classification project, developed as part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course on Coursera. The project aims to implement a simple neural network model for classifying planar data points into two classes.
## About the Project
This project serves as my first attempt at implementing a neural network model while learning about deep learning concepts. The model is trained to classify planar data points based on their features and assign them to one of two classes.
## Files
- main.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the project, including data loading, model training, and evaluation.
- planar_utils.py: Python module containing utility functions for generating and visualizing planar data.
- .gitattributes: Git attributes file.
- .gitignore: Git ignore file to exclude certain files/directories from version control.
- LICENSE: License file specifying the terms of use for the project.
# Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ''' python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/planar-data-classification.git
   '''
3. Open and run the main.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment to interact with the code and experiment with the model.
